# Third Party Signs and Traffic Accidents in Toronto

This project attempts to discover if there is a significant measurable correlation between the presence of third party advertising signs in Toronto and the number of traffic accidents that occur nearby.

## Contents

The project is broken out in this repository as follows:

* **data** - source data files for all python jupyter notebooks
* **final** - the final report and presentation files
* **proposal** - the original proposal document for the project
* **spint 1** - the first submission containing all data exploration and data discovery notes
* **sprint 2** - the second submission containing data modeling notes and results
* **sprint 3** - empty, not used


## Installation

Python 3.6.8 was used to perform the analyses and create the notebooks, and the following libraries were used:

* Pandas 0.25.0
* Numpy 1.16.4
* Xlrd 1.2.0
* Matplotlib 3.1.1

Run the following commands to install the libraries:

```
conda install pandas
conda install numpy
conda install xlrd
conda install matplotlib
conda install seaborn
conda install geopandas
conda install shapely

```

If any of the above are not available, try pulling from conda-forge:

```
conda install -c conda-forge pandas
conda install -c conda-forge numpy
conda install -c conda-forge xlrd
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
conda install -c conda-forge seaborn
conda install -c conda-forge geopandas
conda install -c conda-forge shapely
conda install -c conda-forge fiona
conda install -c conda-forge pycrs
conda install -c conda-forge pysal
```

...or try pip:

```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install xlrd
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install geopandas
pip install shapely
pip install fiona
pip install pycrs
pip install pysal

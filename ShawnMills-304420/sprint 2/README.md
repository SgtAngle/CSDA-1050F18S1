# Sprint 2

### What's in this sprint?
This sprint continues where sprint 1 left off.  Per the feedback provided, an additional dataset of demographic data was introduced into the analysis.  All results and findings are included within the Sprint 2 - Further Development python notebook.

The datasets can be found in the data folder at the root of this github directory.

### What is needed to run this?
Jupyter notebook with the Python 3 engine will be required if you choose to download this project.  Libraries used include:
* pandas
* numpy
* xlrd
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* pysal
* geopandas
* sklearn

### What is the purpose of this?
As per the previous sprint, the goal is to find out if third-party signage has any effect on the number of traffic accidents in the city of Toronto.  Further steps will be taken to determine if there is a pattern relating to the placement of these signs as they relate to the demographics of the surrounding communities.

### Anything else?
Some tools discovered through various tutorials have been made use of, and more tools will be used going forward.  While it was hoped more would have been completed at this point, this is a safe place to cut off work on this project at this time.

A copy of the sprint 1 python notebook has been included separately.  The only addition to it at this time is the line to export the cleansed sign dataset so the sprint 2 notebook could pick up where sprint 1 left off.

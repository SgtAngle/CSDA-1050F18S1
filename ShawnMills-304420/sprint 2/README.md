# Sprint 2

### What's in this sprint?
This sprint continues where sprint 1 left off.  Per the feedback provided, an additional dataset of demographic data was introduced into the analysis.  All results and findings are included within these python notebooks:

* Sprint 1a - Geo-data Discovery
* Sprint 2 - Modeling

Sprint 1a is included only for reference.  The visualization of the geographic data was not part of the original Sprint 1 submission.

The datasets can be found in the data folder at the root of this github directory.

### What is needed to run this?
Jupyter notebook with the Python 3 engine will be required if you choose to download this project.  Libraries used include:

Sprint 1a file:
* pandas
* geopandas
* shapely
* fiona
* matplotlib
* numpy
* pycrs

Sprint 2 file:
* geopandas
* pysal
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn


### What is the purpose of this?
As per the previous sprint, the goal is to find out if third-party signage has any effect on the number of traffic accidents in the city of Toronto.  Further steps will be taken to determine if there is a pattern relating to the placement of these signs as they relate to the demographics of the surrounding communities.

### Anything else?
Some tools discovered through various tutorials have been made use of, and more tools will be used going forward.
